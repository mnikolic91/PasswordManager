# Password Manager (Object-Oriented Programming Final Project)

## Introduction
This Password Manager is the culmination of our Object-Oriented Programming course, employing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, alongside the Observer and Strategy design patterns for a robust, flexible, and efficient password management solution. It integrates seamlessly with a database for secure and persistent storage of passwords.

## Features
- **Secure Password Storage**: Encrypts and stores passwords safely.
- **MVC Architecture**: Adopts Model-View-Controller design for maintainable and scalable code.
- **Design Pattern Integration**: Utilizes Observer and Strategy patterns for dynamic updates and flexible encryption.
- **Database Connectivity**: Ensures data persistence and security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for straightforward password management.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java (Version 8 or higher recommended)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Encryption**: Simple mock encryption for simplicity, can be changed flexibly
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ

## How It Works
1. **Model**: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
2. **View**: Represents the UI, which can be dynamically updated.
3. **Controller**: Translates inputs to commands for the model or view.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Java (Version 8 or higher).
3. Set up the database using the schema in the `database` folder.
4. Update database configuration with your credentials.
5. Compile and run the application.
